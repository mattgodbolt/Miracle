## Miracle - a Javascript Sega Master System emulator

Requires `make`, `perl` and `python` to build. Place ROMs in the `public/roms` directory as
`romname.sms` and then run `make` to build the emulation script files and the ROM data.

To run locally run `npm run dev` and then go to http://localhost:5173.

z80 emulation and test are based on rev 1071 of http://svn.matt.west.co.tt/svn/jsspec/trunk
