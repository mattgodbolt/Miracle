Miracle - a Javascript Sega Master System emulator
--------------------------------------------------

TODO RE-DOCUMENT AND TEST

Requires `make`, `perl` and `python` to build.  Place ROMs in the `roms` directory as
`romname.sms` and then run `make` to build the emulation script files and the ROM data.

z80 emulation and test are based on rev 1071 of http://svn.matt.west.co.tt/svn/jsspec/trunk
